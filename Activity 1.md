## what is API  

The definition or meaning of an API is a set of protocols used to create and integrate application programs. APIs exist between the web server and the application and act as an intermediary between the two.

## API types

- Public API : this API is available and open for anyone (developer or business)

- Partner API : is a tool for facilitating business-to-business transactions that is only available to a restricted group of outside developers or API users.

- Internal APIs : Internal (or private) APIs are designed to link systems and data within a company.

- Composite API :  is made up of two or more APIs that work together to provide a series of linked or interdependent actions. Composite APIs can be useful for addressing complicated or closely linked API behaviors, and they can occasionally outperform individual APIs in terms of speed and performance.

## benfits of API

- Increases productivity.
- Saves costs.
- Improves connectivity and collaboration.
- Encourages innovation.
- Enhances customer experience.

## waht is the defrant between SDK and API

SDK (Software Development Kit) is a collection of software development tools. These are largely employed in the development of various applications. Application Programming Interface (API) stands for Application Programming Interface. As a result, APIs are focused on communication or engagement, whereas APIs are focused on application development.

Web APIs are usually simple and serve a specific function. SDKs may be rather large and complex.

It's simple to update with Web APIs. In many situations, API users are not required to alter their code in order to benefit from the enhanced APIs. Users that utilize SDKs must generally download the updates to their local environment and recompile their program.
